Project: Laboratory Work on "Web Technologies" on the Topic "Continents"

Goal of the Project: Introduction to key web technologies, creation of a multi-page web application with dynamic content and database interaction.

Main Tasks:

Developing an HTML page — creating the structure of a web page using basic HTML elements (tags, forms, tables, etc.).
Creating a multi-page website — setting up navigation between different pages using menus and links.
Working with CSS — styling the website using Flexbox and Grid for creating responsive layouts and tables.
Dynamic content updating — integrating with a database (XAMPP, phpMyAdmin), creating SQL queries, and using PHP to fetch and display data on the website pages.


Outcome: Creation of an interactive website with the ability to add, edit, and delete continent data via an admin panel, demonstrating skills in database management and modern web technologies.
